===============
Static method
===============
##It is like normal method but lies within class
##It does not required self argument
##we can call it with object or directly with class name
##Syntax : 
class Name:
 @staticmethod
 def fun(arg2,arg2)

Name.fun(par1,par2)          ==>directly with calss name
obj.fun(par1,par2)           ==>with object

##So why we need it just create simple function outside of class
 REASON : if some one import this class and we want that some one can also use this function 
##It is called uitility function




=============
Static method
=============
self if just like function it is can be sue without considering object of class 

Difference :

1) Actual difference between simple function and and static method is that it lies with in class
but simpkke fubnction do not belong to class.
2) The difference between Normal method and static method is Normal method belong to some object
and static method do not belong to any object 
    In simple method we have to pass self argument 
    But in static method there is no need of pass self 

It simply do not associated to any class or instance
**But to call them we have to either use use instance or class**
Use :
If we want to ship any class to other program and want to share some method that we can not 
directly import method so we have to use static method

Syntax :
  @staticmethod
  def function():
    defination

Example : 
class Math:
  @staticmethod(slef,n):
  def add(a,b):
    return a+b

print(a.add(10,20))
print(Math.add(10,20))
