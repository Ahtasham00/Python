if __name__ == "__main__":
=====================
Problem : when we create module and import it in other program than it will excute autoamticaly its code
Example:
## module1
 def funadd(a,b)
  print(a+b)
 funadd(10,20)
##module2
 import module1    
 //Now it will automaticaly excute funadd(10,20) function as it call in module1
##This is big problem
SOLUTION : To avoid this problem we can use "" if __name__ == "__main__" ""
Explain : This line of code will tell program that if the this file excute directly than excute it 
          otherwise not

    
syntax :
 if __name__ == "__main__":
  block of code
  function calling
Example :
 def main():
   print("Python for every one")
 if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()                       //Now this main will only excute if this file directly excute
                                //otherwise if this module import in another module than it will
                                //not excute

==============================================================================================
 What actully __name__ is ?   importantconcept 1.4

if we print(__name__)  in file that directly excute instead of used in other module 
Than output will be __main__
But if we write print(__name__) in module1 and import module1 in module2 
Than output will be name of module 

So thats why we use this condition ""if __name__ == "__main__"" mean excute from orignal file
than if conditin will be true as result code given below will excute other wise in case of name
of file condition will be false and as result code below to __main__ will not excute
