#SYNTAX
while(condition):
 block of code
 
#EXAMPLE
val=0
while(val<5)
  print(val)
  val=val+1

#EXAMPLE
val="Y"
while(val=="Y"):
 print("Run RUN RUN")
 val=input("Do you want to run again if Yes Press Y if NO press N")

##There is no do while loop in python 
  In do while loop first time loop will excute whatever condition is
  But second time to excute it will check condition

##To emulate do while loop 

while True:
 print(i)
 i=i+1
 if(i%100==0):
 break
=>This work same as do while loop 
=>First time it excute irrespective of condition
=>Second time it will check condition
