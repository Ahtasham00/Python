Exception Handling
=====================
For Error handling in python we use Try Except Code

#when error generated
 Error generated due to different reasons like invalid userinput,network issue,fileNotfound etc..
#Result of error
 As result of error program stop and not excute codeof all next lines where error generated
=========  
Solution  we can handel error Through exception handling as result rest of code will excute
========= as normal.The code that generate error be will handeled

Syntax :
try: 
 #Body of cade
except Exception as e:
 print(e)     e store error that generated 

syntax :
try:
 #Body of cdoe
excpet:
 print("Message that you want do display")

##There  are many types of error we can handle each of them seperatly 
Syntax:
try:
#Body of code 
except errorName
Example:
try:
 num=input("Enter value")
except valueError:             //value error generated when user Enter invalid input 
 print("value error occur") 

##One statement can generate multitypes of error
Syntax:
try:
#Body of code 
except errorName1:
print("error generated due of errorName")
except errorName2:
print("error generated due of errorName")
except errorName3:
print("error generated due of errorName")
