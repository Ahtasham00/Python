Super Keyword
=============
It is basically use in inheritance 
##when we call parent function from child class we need to "super()" Keyword

Example:let suppose in parent and child class both have method with same name
        if we simple write method name in child class python consider it as 
        method of child But if we want to class parent method we need to specify 
        supeer().function know python will understand that the specify method is from 
        Parent class
 class Parent:
  def hyfunction(self):
   print("hy from Parent")
  def onlyinParent(self):
   print("Only in parent")
 class Child(Parent):
   def hyfunction(self):
    print("Hy from shild")
 
obj=Parent()
obj.hyfunction()
obj.onlyinParent()        ///As onlyinparent() function is only in parent so when we call
                       this function as it is not in child class it will then check function 
                       of parent class
