How to declare private attribute

syntax  : __attribute,self.__attribute
Example : __name,self.__name 

##"Name mangling" in python
 we can not access private data member directly
 But we can access private data member through name mangling
 It is technique to protect private datameber from being accidently overwrite

Syntax  :   obj._<Class>__<attribute>
Example :   obj._Person__name

But by using name mangling technique we can access them 

Whole Example:
class Person:
 def __init__(self,name,age):
  self.__name=name  ->private
  self.age=age      ->public
