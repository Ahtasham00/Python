Operator overloading
=====================
whenever we want to perform operation between two instance of class we need operator overloading

Example:
a=10
b=20  
c=a+b
Bur let suppose

classname obj1,obj2
obj1+obj2             //we can not add obj1+obj2 Bcoz python is not intelligent enough


to perform operation we have to use operator overloading

Syntax : 
for each operation we have some resorve name like 

for + we have to use  __add__(self,obj)
for - we have to use  __sub__(self,obj)


to check list of operator use google

Example :

class Vector:
 def __init__(self,a,b,c):
  self.a=a
  self.b=b
  self.c=c
 def __add__(self,obj):
  return Vector(self.a+obj.a,self.b+obj.b,self.c+obj.c)

obj1=Vector(1,2,3)
obj2=Vector(4,5,6)
print(obj1.__add__(obj2))
